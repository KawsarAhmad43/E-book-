        cout<<"it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess."<<endl;
        cout<<"Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead,"<<endl;
        cout<<"and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses."<<endl;
        cout<<"On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept."<<endl;
        cout<<"Oh, very badly! said she. I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed,"<<endl;
        cout<<"but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!"<<endl;

        cout<<"Oh, that can be easily managed,said the fairy.Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer's fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen."<<endl;
        cout<<"Thank you,said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud."<<endl;
        cout<<"It is a beautiful flower,said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden."<<endl;
        cout<<"She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of Thumbelina,or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle;"<<endl;
        cout<<" her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table,"<<endl;
        cout<<"where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf,"<<endl;
        cout<<"which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight. Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard."<<endl;
        cout<<"One night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane of glass in the window, and leaped right upon the table where Tiny lay sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt."<<endl;
        cout<<"What a pretty little wife this would make for my son,said the toad, and she took up the walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay asleep, and jumped through the window with it into the garden."<<endl;

        cout<<"One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it, saying that he could use it as a cradle, when he had children of his own."<<endl;

        cout<<"The snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not."<<endl;
        cout<<" Lights were shining from every window, and there was a savory smell of roast goose, for it was New-year's eve - yes, she remembered that. In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other,"<<endl;
        cout<<"she sank down and huddled herself together. She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home,"<<endl;
        cout<<"for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money. Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here,"<<endl;
        cout<<"for they had only the roof to cover them, through which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags."<<endl;
